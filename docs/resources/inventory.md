### Nested Schema for `group.group.group.host`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the host.

Optional:

- `ansible_become` (Boolean) Allows you to force privilege escalation.
- `ansible_become_exe` (String) Allows you to set the executable for the escalation method you selected.
- `ansible_become_flags` (String) Allows you to set the flags passed to the selected escalation method
- `ansible_become_method` (String) Allows you to set the privilege escalation method to a matching become plugin.
- `ansible_become_password` (String, Sensitive) Allows you to set the privilege escalation password.
- `ansible_become_user` (String) Allows you to set the user you become through privilege escalation.
- `ansible_connection` (String) Specifies the connection type to the host. This can be the name of any Ansible connection plugin. SSH protocol types are ssh or paramiko. The default is ssh.
- `ansible_host` (String) Specifies the resolvable name or IP of the host to connect to, if it is different from the alias (name) you wish to give to it.
- `ansible_password` (String, Sensitive) The password to use when connecting (logging in) to the host.
- `ansible_port` (Number) The connection port number, if not the default (22 for ssh).
- `ansible_private_key_file` (String) Private key file used by SSH. This is useful if you use multiple keys and you do not want to use SSH agent.
- `ansible_python_interpreter` (String) Allows you to set the Python interpreter to use for the target system.

- `ansible_shell_type` (String) Specifies the shell type of the target system. You should not use this setting unless you have set the `ansible_shell_executable` to a non-Bourne (sh) compatible shell.  By default, Ansible formats commands using sh-style syntax.  If you set this to csh or fish, commands that Ansible executes on target systems follow those shell’s syntax instead.
- `ansible_ssh_common_args` (String) Ansible always appends this setting to the default command line for sftp, scp, and ssh. This is useful for configuring a ``ProxyCommand` for a certain host or group.
- `ansible_ssh_executable` (String) Specify the SSH executable to use.
- `ansible_ssh_extra_args` (String) Extra arguments to pass to the ssh command.
- `ansible_ssh_pipelining` (Boolean) Enable pipelining for SSH connections.
- `ansible_user` (String) The username to use when connecting (logging in) to the host.
